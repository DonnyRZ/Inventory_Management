# Inventory Prediction with Physics-Aware Processing

This project demonstrates a physics-aware inventory forecasting pipeline using Google Colab and PyTorch. The system handles temporal feature engineering, leakage-proof data preprocessing, and builds a robust transformer model to predict inventory levels while respecting physical constraints.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Open the Notebook in Google Colab
1. Save the code from this repository as a `.ipynb` file (Jupyter Notebook).
2. Upload the notebook to your Google Drive or directly open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

---

## Installation and Setup

### Install Required Libraries
Run the following command in your Colab environment to install the necessary Python libraries:
```python
!pip install openpyxl statsmodels --quiet
!pip install --upgrade torch torchvision --quiet
```

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your Dataset
1. Ensure your dataset is in `.xlsx` format and contains the following columns:
   - `Date` (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - `Product Name`
   - `Quantity in Stock (liters/kg)`
   - Additional categorical features (`Sales Channel`, `Farm Size`, etc.)
2. Upload the file using:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```
   Select your `.xlsx` file when prompted.

---

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed with the following steps:
1. **Date Parsing and Sorting**: Converts `Date` to datetime, and sorts by `Product Name` and `Date`.
2. **Zero Handling with Physical Constraints**: Replaces zero values in the target column with the minimum non-zero value for the same product.
3. **Temporal Features**: Adds `day_of_week`, `day_of_month`, and `days_since_first` features.

Run the preprocessing script:
```python
df = pd.read_excel(file_name, sheet_name=0)
# Preprocessing code here
```

---

### Step 3: Splitting the Dataset
Perform a temporal split to divide the data into training and testing sets:
```python
train_df, test_df = temporal_product_split(df)
```

---

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
1. **Rolling Aggregations**: Compute `weekly_median` and `monthly_max` for each product.
2. **Lag Features**: Generate lagged values (`lag_3`, `lag_7`, `lag_14`) for the target variable.

Generate features:
```python
train_df = create_physical_features(train_df)
test_df = create_physical_features(test_df, train_ref=train_df)
```

---

### Step 5: Encoding and Scaling
1. Encode categorical variables:
   ```python
   train_df[col] = oe.fit_transform(train_df[[col]].astype(str))
   test_df[col] = oe.transform(test_df[[col]].astype(str))
   ```
2. Scale the target variable using product-specific `RobustScaler`:
   ```python
   train_df['scaled_target'] = product_scale(train_df)
   test_df['scaled_target'] = product_scale(test_df)
   ```

---

### Step 6: Sequence Generation
Prepare sequences for the transformer model:
```python
X_train_num, X_train_cat, y_train, train_products = create_sequences(train_df)
X_test_num, X_test_cat, y_test, test_products = create_sequences(test_df)
```
Convert the sequences into PyTorch tensors:
```python
X_train_num_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(X_train_num)
X_train_cat_tensor = torch.LongTensor(X_train_cat)
y_train_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(y_train)
```

---

### Step 7: Model Definition
The model is a transformer-based neural network:
```python
class InventoryTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Model architecture
```
This model uses:
- **Embeddings** for products and categorical variables.
- **Transformers** for temporal pattern recognition.
- **Physical Constraints**: Ensures outputs are non-negative and below maximum capacity.

---

### Step 8: Model Training
Define a training loop to optimize the model:
```python
# Training loop here
```

---

### Step 9: Evaluation
Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and plot predictions vs. actual values:
```python
# Evaluation code
```

---

## Key Features
- **Physics-Aware Processing**: Enforces physical constraints such as non-negative inventory.
- **Temporal Feature Engineering**: Captures time-based patterns with lag features and rolling aggregates.
- **Transformer Model**: Employs attention mechanisms for robust inventory forecasting.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets with multiple products.
